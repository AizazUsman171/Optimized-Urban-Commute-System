# Optimized-Urban-Commute-System
Our project aims to revolutionize how urban commuters experience public transportation by offering a user-friendly tool combining advanced DSA techniques with Java programming. We provide commuters with real-time access to the shortest path options and precise time estimates for their chosen bus routes.
